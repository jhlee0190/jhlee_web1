  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.

<p style="margin-top:40px;>"Like everything in the world, HTML develops continuously, and, as the browsers become more sophisticated and support published standards better, webmasters change their approach to how they use HTML. In the past it used to be the norm to use HTML for visual formatting of the web text, and tags like <font> with various attributes setting the size and colour of the font were widely used. Today the accepted approach is that HTML should be responsible mainly for semantic markup (to tell the browsers and other software where the paragraph begins, where it ends, where numbered and unnumbered lists are, etc…) and the presentation should, wnerever possible, be delegated to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets – another language that good webmasters are expected to speak). Using CSS, a webmaster can change the way the texton the whole website looks by changing just one line of code, whereas with pure HTML and font tags it would take changing a lot of tags on a lot of pages – and countless hours to do so. In HTML 4.01 the <font> tag is considered deprecated.
